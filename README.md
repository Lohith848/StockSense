## What is StockSense?

**StockSense** is a web application that analyzes real-time stock news and market data for any ticker symbol and returns a clear sentiment signal — **Bullish , Bearish , or Neutral ** — along with a plain-English explanation of why.

Built for retail investors who don't have time to read 50 articles before making a trade decision.
